## What

This is experimental cmake build system.

To use it:
* install latest cmake (2.8.12 at this time) and make sure cmake.exe is in
  %PATH% (it's an option during installation)
* run one of the generator scripts e.g. cmake/gen-vs8.bat

This generates Visual Studio files in cmake/vs8 directory. Open all.sln and
build the target you want.

## Why

I don't like cmake but it seems to be the least bad option. premake isn't
developed very actively. gyp is developed actively but Chrome is working
on a new build system which might mean end of gyp.

Our nmake system got to a point where I dread making any changes.

Things I would like to have in a build system:
* generates native Visual Studio files for easy development
* support for 64 bits
* support for building for xp under VS 2012/2013
* relatively save way of adding more targets (libraries/executables)

## Problems with cmake

It's large and complicated so there will be some work to re-create current
build.

I'm not sure how well cmake can handle things like generating files like we
do in mupdf. If I can't figure out this in cmake, it's always possible to
simplify and require that (currently) generated files have to be re-generated
when updating mupdf and kept in svn.
