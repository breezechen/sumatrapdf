unarr is a decompression library for RAR, ZIP and 7z archives.

unarr originated as a port of the RAR extraction features from
The Unarchiver project required for extracting images from comic
book archives (.cbr). It was written as an alternative to
libarchive which didn't have support for parsing filters or solid
compression at the time.

There is currently no dedicated Makefile for building unarr (see
../makefile.msvc for what SumatraPDF does). Compiling unarr should
however be as simple as compiling all files with a C99 compatible
compiler (omit main.c if you want to use it as a library).

The following symbols can be defined if other libraries are present
in the include path:
