TODO list for Sumatra PDF.

Must have before next (0.2) release:
- reimplement void WinPDFCore::resizeToPage(int pg)
- much better "About" box
- handle links (actions)
- Ctrl-G - "go to page" dialog
- better mapping of fonts, default to some font if can't find a named mapping
- access encrypted files
- Go To page dialog

Nice to have:
- Widgets should be links as well
- remember the history of opened files (infinite "Recent Files"). Remember file name and
  UI state (windows posisition, current page, zoom level, scroll position) at the time
  file was close. Restore the UI state when file is re-opened. That way user gets where
  he left off, which is probably what he wants most of the time. Might want to make it
  user-configurable option (not sure if that's what all of the people would want).
  History is infinite (as opposed to only N recently opened, as in most software).
- good UI for history of opened files. At the very least a type-down list, ordered by
  last access time. Type-down filters by file name (or maybe full path?). Filter out
  files that don't exist anymore (and remove them from history)
- session saving (similar to what a Firefox extension does). Save the whole state of the app (windows
  position, which PDF file is open, current page, zoom level, scroll position etc.). Restore the
  session when called without a command-line argument.
- cursor up/down and page up/down should advance pages if at the top/bottom
- check for new version on-line
- toolbar (?)
- easy toggle to full-screen mode (Ctrl-L ?)
- UI for table of contents
- bookmarks per PDF, persisted across sessions. UI for handling bookmarks (add bookmark, delete
  bookmark, go to bookmark). 2 cases need to be handled: going to a bookmark in the currently
  displayed PDF file. Going to a "global" bookmark, across all PDF files (i.e. show a list
  of all bookmarks in all PDF files, grouped by PDF file). Those 2 cases need separate UI.
- "launch with acrobat" option (menu item?), so that it's easy to launch a doc
  with acrobat if it implements an important function that I don't (e.g. priting)
  Needs to read registry to find where acrobat is installed.
- easy toggle of full-screen mode (Ctrl-L ?)
- detect if *pdf files are associsated with me at startup, if not, either silently
  restore or have a dialog box
- printing
- get rid of dependency on freetype, use windows functions instead (not sure if that's
  possible with poppler)
- optimize the use of embedded fonts, currently they're being written out
  to disk and then read into memory, which seems completely unnecessary since
  freetype can create a face directly from memory.
  Also, it uses char-by-char IO, which is slow, switch to reading/writing in
  chunks.
- nicer-looking window
 - drop shadows
 - custom caption area
- replace windows font scanning code with a better version from mupdf
- C:\kjk\downloads\6.05.HowToBeCreative.pdf popup on every page (but FoxIt PDF also does that)
- use memory mapped files to speedup stuff

Done:
- "Go To" (next/prev/first/last,page) menu
- fix flicker with double buffering
- backspace to do the opposite of space
- bug: window size slightly changes at startup, don't know why
- drawing issues resolved (SetDIBSToDevice is driving me crazy)
- facing and continuous facing mode
- Rotate left/right
