                        TODO list for Sumatra PDF.

To see the most up-to date list of planned future fixes and enhancements (and add to this list as well), 
visit: http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/list

This is a list of features that I thought of at some point but probably won't be
implemented (for one reason or another):
- select images
- integrate with google desktop search so that you can find *.pdf files easily 
  directly from the app (does it make sense? what if it's just as easy to find
  the files from desktop search?)
- annotation support
- reading of C:\kjk\test_pdfs\pda\palm\dev tools\sdk\user_interface.pdf takes 
  an awfully long time
- get rid of dependency on freetype, use windows functions instead (not sure if that's
  possible with poppler)
- optimize the use of embedded fonts, currently they're being written out
  to disk and then read into memory, which seems completely unnecessary since
  freetype can create a face directly from memory.
  Also, it uses char-by-char IO, which is slow, switch to reading/writing in
  chunks.
- replace windows font scanning code with a better version from mupdf
- C:\kjk\downloads\6.05.HowToBeCreative.pdf popup on every page (but FoxIt PDF also does that)
- use memory mapped files to speedup stuff
