= How to submit bug reports =

Did you find a bug in Sumatra? Please reate a bug report in our [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/list bug tracker].

Does it involve a specific PDF (or CHM or XPS or ...) file? 

It's important to provide us with a file that shows the problem by e.g. uploading it to [http://ge.tt ge.tt] or attaching to a bug report.

If the file (or other information) is confidential, you can e-mail it directly to SumatraPDF developers: zeniko@gmail.com (Simon BÃ¼nzli) and kkowalczyk@gmail.com (Krzysztof Kowalczyk).
