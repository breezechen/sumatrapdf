= How to submit bug reports =

Did you find a bug in Sumatra? Create a bug report in our [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/list bug tracker].

Does it involve a specific PDF? It's important to provide us with a PDF that shows the problem by e.g. uploading it to [http://ge.tt ge.tt] or attaching to a bug report.

If the PDF (or other information) is confidential, you can e-mail it directly to SumatraPDF developers: zeniko@gmail.com (Simon BÃ¼nzli) and kkowalczyk@gmail.com (Krzysztof Kowalczyk).
