Sometimes people are unclear on how to remove/uninstall Sumatra. This guide tries to explain that.

== Are you using official Sumatra build? ==

Did you download Sumatra from [http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/download-free-pdf-viewer.html our website]?

If not, we can't help you because we didn't create the software you're using.

== Uninstalling Sumatra ==

We offer 2 versions: an installer and a zipped executable.

== Uninstalling zipped executable ==

If you're using zipped executable, the only thing you need to do is to delete SumatraPDF.exe.

== Uninstalling the installer version ==

If you're using an installer version, you must have ran an [http://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/8nqb/Writing-a-custom-installer-for-Windows-software.html installer].

The installer creates the standard uninstallation shortucts so go to Control Panel, use "Uninstall a program" category. SumatraPDF should be listed there and you can double-click to uninstall it.
