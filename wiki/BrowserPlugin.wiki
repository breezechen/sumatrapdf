#summary Why we're removing browser plugin after 2.5.x

After 2.5.x we'll remove browser plugin from Sumatra.

Why?

Chrome will completely remove support for NPAPI plugins (and Sumatra's plugin is based on NPAPI) in 2014 (http://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation).

!FireFox will require a click to activate NPAPI plugin each time, which is very user unfriendly and will surely decrease number of people using the plugin (https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/01/29/putting-users-in-control-of-plugins/)

For those reasons we won't be including browser plugin in Sumatra past 2.5.x

That being said, we won't be deleting/disabling it, so if you really want it, you can install 2.5.2 and then upgrade, which will preserve the plugin.
