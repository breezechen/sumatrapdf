#summary describes design of how we persist settings.
#labels devnote

This document provides high-level overview of how Sumatra stores settings.

Persisted data is stored in sumatrapdfprefs.dat file. In portable version the file is stored in the same directory as SumatraPDF executable. In non-portable version, it's in %APPDATA%\SumatraPDF directory.

The data is serialized to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode bencode] format (because it's compact and easy to implement).

Core bencode serialization logic is in [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/src/utils/BencUtil.cpp BencUtil.cpp]. The actual serializatioz/deserialization of application data is in [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/src/AppPrefs.cpp AppPrefs.cpp] (this is a place to consult to see what data we persist).

Starting with version 1.6 we also persist thumbnails for "Frequently read" list. They are stored in subdirectory sumatrapdfcache as .png files.
