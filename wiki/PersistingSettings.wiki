#summary describes design of how we persist settings.
#labels devnote

This document provides high-level overview of how Sumatra stores settings.

Persisted data is stored in SumatraPDF-settings.txt file. In portable version the file is stored in the same directory as SumatraPDF executable. In non-portable version, it's in %APPDATA%\SumatraPDF directory.

Starting with version 1.6 we also persist thumbnails for "Frequently read" list. They are stored in subdirectory sumatrapdfcache as .png files.

Note: in earlier version settings were stored in sumatrapdfprefs.dat file in  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode bencode] format.
