#summary describes design of how we persist settings.

This document provides high-level overview of how Sumatra stores settings.

Persisted data is stored in SumatraPDF-settings.txt file. In portable version the file is stored in the same directory as SumatraPDF executable. In non-portable version, it's in %APPDATA%\SumatraPDF directory.

Starting with version 1.6 we also persist thumbnails for "Frequently read" list. They are stored in subdirectory sumatrapdfcache as .png files.

See http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/settings.html for more information about all the settings which are currently stored and [https://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/scripts/gen_settingsstructs.py /scripts/gen_settingsstructs.py] for what to change in order to add new settings.

Note: In earlier version settings were stored in sumatrapdfprefs.dat file in  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode bencode] format.
