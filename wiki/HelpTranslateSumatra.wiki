#summary How to translate Sumatra

Sumatra is translated into many languages but we rely on you to help us keep translations for your language up to date.

To help us translate Sumatra:
 * go to [http://www.apptranslator.org/app/SumatraPDF apptranslator.org]
 * log-in with your Twitter account
 * click on a language you're familiar with
 * add new translations or improve existing translations

To get notified about new strings that need to be translated you can subscribe to an rss feed for your language in an RSS reader of your choice (personally, I use Google Reader)
