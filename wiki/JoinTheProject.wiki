#summary How to join SumatraPDF project as a developer

= How to join SumatraPDF project =

SumatraPDF is an open-source, [http://www.ohloh.net/p/4623/contributors collaborative] project. We always welcome new developers who want to join the project, contribute code and new features.

The process is simple:
 * write a patch against the latest sources
 * create a new bug in [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/list issue tracker] and attach the patch.
 * make sure to describe what the patch is trying to do and why (not every change is good)
 * we'll review the patch and either incorporate it into sources (if we think it's good) or describe how it needs to be improved

There's plenty of things [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/list to work on].

== Getting the sources and compiling ==

To get the latest sources, follow [http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/checkout those instructions].

You'll need Visual Studio 2010 or 2008 to build. A free [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express#2010-Visual-CPP Express Edition] for C++ will work.

Open sumatrapdf-vc2010.sln, compile and run.
