#summary SumatraPDF command line options

= Command Line Overview =

The general format of the command line for SumatraPDF is
{{{
SumatraPDF.exe [Options ...] [Filepath ...]
}}}

All options start with a dash and have (where indicated) arguments that have to follow them immediately. Anything that isn't recognized as an option will be interpreted as a file path. It's possible to freely mix file paths and command line options.

= List of recognized command line options =

  * {{{-bg-color <hexcolor>}}}

  Changes the yellow background color to a different color. See e.g. http://html-color-codes.info/webfarben_hexcodes/ for a way to generate the hexcode for a color. 
  E.g.

  {{{
  -bg-color #999999
  }}}
  changes the color to gray.

  * {{{-esc-to-exit}}}
  
  Enables the Escape key to quit SumatraPDF and stores that setting in sumatrapdfprefs.dat. To revert it, delete sumatrapdfprefs.dat.

  * {{{-set-color-range <text-hexcolor> <background-hexcolor>}}}
  
  Uses the given two colors for foreground and background and maps all other colors used in a document in between these two.

  E.g.
  {{{
  -set-color-range #dddddd #333333
  }}}
  displays soft white text on a dark gray background.

  * {{{-invert-colors}}}
  
  Is a shortcut for
  {{{
  -set-color-range #ffffff #000000
  }}}
  i.e. will display white text on a black background for most documents.

  * {{{-presentation}}}
  
  Displays the first indicated file directly in presentation view.

  * {{{-fullscreen}}}
  
  Displays the first indicated file directly in fullscreen view.

  * {{{-reuse-instance}}}
  
  Tells an already open SumatraPDF to load the indicated files. If there are several running instances, behavior is undefined.

  * {{{-lang <language-code>}}}
  
  Sets the UI language. See http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/strings/index.tsv for the list of available language codes.
  
  E.g.
  {{{
  -lang de
  }}}

  * {{{-register-for-pdf}}}
  
  Registers SumatraPDF as the default PDF reader for the current user and (if the user is administrator) for all other users. After the registration, SumatraPDF exits immediately.

  * {{{-restrict}}}
  
  Locks SumatraPDF down so that it doesn't allow access to any drives, the registry or the internet. See http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/docs/sumatrapdfrestrict.ini for a more subtle alternative.

== Printing options ==

  * {{{-print-to-default}}}
  
  Prints all files indicated on this command line to the system default printer. After printing, SumatraPDF exits immediately (check the error code for failure).

  * {{{-print-to <printer-name>}}}
  
  Prints all files indicated on this command line to the named printer. After printing, SumatraPDF exits immediately (check the error code for failure).
  
  E.g.
  {{{
  -print-to "Microsoft XPS Document Writer"
  }}}
  prints all indicated files to the XPS virtual printer.

  * {{{-print-settings <settings-list>}}}
  
  Used in combination with {{{-print-to}}} and {{{-print-to-default}}}. Allows to tweak some of the printing related settings without using the Print dialog. The settings-list is a comma separated list of page ranges and advanced options such as "even" or "odd" and "noscale", "shrink" and "fit".
  
  E.g.
  {{{
  -print-settings "1-3,5,10-8,odd,fit"
  }}}
  prints pages 1, 3, 5, 9 (i.e. the odd pages from the ranges 1-3, 5-5 and 10-8) and scales them so that they fit into the printable area of the paper.

  * {{{-silent}}}
  
  Used in combination with {{{-print-to}}} and {{{-print-to-default}}}. Silences any error messages related to command line printing.

  * {{{-print-dialog}}}
  
  Displays the Print dialog for all the files indicated on this command line.

  * {{{-exit-on-print}}}
  
  Used in combination with {{{-print-dialog}}}. Exits SumatraPDF after the Print dialog has been dismissed (and the document printed).

== Options related to forward/inverse search (for LaTeX editors) ==

  * {{{-inverse-search <command-line>}}}
  
  Sets the command line to be used for performing an inverse search from a PDF document (usually back to a LaTeX source file). The inverse search command line can also be set from the Setting dialog. Use the variable %f for the current filename and %l for the current line.

  * {{{-forward-search <sourcepath> <line>}}}
  
  Performs a forward search from a LaTeX source file to a loaded PDF document (using PdfSync or SyncTeX). This is an alternative to the ForwardSearch DDE command.
  
  E.g.
  {{{
  -forward-search main.tex 123
  }}}
  highlights all text related to line 123 in main.tex.

  * {{{-fwdsearch-offset <offset> -fwdsearch-width <width> -fwdsearch-color <hexcolor> -fwdsearch-permanent <flag>}}}
  
  Allows to customize the forward search highlight. Set the offset to a positive number to change the highlight style to a rectangle at the left of the page (instead of rectangles over the whole text). The flag for {{{-fwdsearch-permanent}}} can be 0 (make the highlight fade away, default) or 1.

== Navigation options ==

  * {{{-named-dest <destination-name>}}}
  
  Searches the first indicated file for a destination or a table-of-contents entry matching destination-name and scrolls the document to it. Combine with {{{-reuse-instance}}} if the document is already open.

  * {{{-page <pageNo>}}}
  
  Scrolls the first indicated file to the indicated page. Combine with {{{-reuse-instance}}} if the document is already open.

  * {{{-view <view-mode>}}}
  
  Sets the view mode for the first indicated file. Alternatives are "single page", "continuous single page", "facing", "continuous facing", "book view", "continuous book view".

  * {{{-zoom <zoom-level>}}}
  
  Sets the zoom level for the first indicated file. Alternatives are "fit page", "fit width", "fit content" or any percentage value.

  * {{{-scroll <x,y>}}}
  
  Scrolls to the given coordinates for the first indicated file.

== Developer options ==

  * {{{-console}}}
  
  Opens a console window alongside SumatraPDF for accessing (MuPDF) debug output. For slightly more extensive debug messages, first set the environment variable MULOG=a.

  * {{{-stress-test <path> [file-filter] [range] [cycle-count]}}}
  
  Renders all pages of the indicated file/directory for stability and performance testing.
  
  E.g.
  {{{
  -stress-test file1.pdf 25x
  -stress-test file2.pdf 1-3
  -stress-test dir *.pdf;*.xps 15- 3x
  }}}
  renders file1.pdf 25 times, renders pages 1 to 3 of file2.pdf and renders all but the first 14 PDF and XPS files from dir 3 times.

  * {{{-bench <filepath> [page-range]}}}
  
  Renders all pages (or just the indicated ones) for the given file 10 times and then outputs the required rendering times for performance testing and comparisons. Often used together with {{{-console}}}.

  * {{{-plugin [url] <hwnd>}}}
  
  Makes SumatraPDF a child of the given window, so that it can be used as a plugin. Optionally pass in a URL/filepath that should be displayed instead of the actual filename (in case the actual filename is a temporary file).
